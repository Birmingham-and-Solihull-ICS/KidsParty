## Cake

__Classic Vanilla Sponge Cake Recipe__

__Ingredients__:

+ 200g (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened

+ 200g (1 cup) caster sugar

+ 200g (1⅔ cups) self-raising flour

+ 4 large eggs

+ 1 tsp vanilla extract

+ 2 tbsp milk (optional – for extra moisture)

+ A pinch of salt

__Optional__: Buttercream or whipped cream and jam for filling, and icing sugar for dusting.

__Instructions__:

+ Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) or 160°C (fan). Grease and line two 8-inch (20cm) round cake tins.

+ Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer until light and fluffy (about 3–5 minutes).

+ Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

+ Mix in the vanilla extract.

+ Sift in the self-raising flour and salt. Gently fold it into the mixture using a spatula or spoon.

+ Add the milk if the batter feels too thick – it should drop off the spoon easily.

+ Divide the batter evenly between the two cake tins. Smooth the tops.

+ Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the cakes are golden and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.

+ Cool in the tins for 5–10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
