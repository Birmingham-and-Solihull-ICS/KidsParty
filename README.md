# Kids Party

This is a training excerise for GitHub.  We are doing something a bit daft, rather than using production code to learn.
So no Python / R / SQL etc. today.

___Let's plan a kids birthday party...___

# First things first:
+ __Please create your own 'fork' of this repository, but clicking the fork button at the top right__
+ Continue by cloning the repository down to your machine (setting up a local copy)

+ When you push your changes to GitHub, they will go to your fork e.g. chrismainey/KidsParty.
+ When you are ready to contribute them to the main repositiory, select 'contribute' and open a 'Pull request'
+ CM will review / comment / accept / request changes

## GitHub jargon 

+ __Issues:__ the place to record all questions and queries relating to the repository
+ __Wiki:__ a place to record infromation about the project in a structured way.
+ __Actions:__ a mechanism to run code and automation jobs.  Not used in this exercise.
+ __Projects:__ a project management section to organised jobs.  Can convert issues.
+ __Pull-request:__ a request from you to have your code (in your fork) pulled into the main repository (bsol one in this case). Pull requests are checked and approved before merging.


# Activities

We are meeting on the 04/07/2025, and we are planning a kids party for 26/04/2025.

Your venue is the Village Hall, at 11 a.m.

We need to adopt a few roles, and figure out and/plan and decide on a few tasks.
Set up a plan and assign some responsibilities.

## Roles

+ Party planner (you are going to be the boss of the planning elements)  -  you can also be part of another team


+ __Team Invitations__
+ __Team Catering__
+ __Team __Games__
+ Master of Ceremonies / Dugeon Master / Bringer of Mayhem...  (Other titles/insults for 'organiser' are also valid)

Please divide yourself up into teams (one person in a team is ok.)





## Activities

### Planning
+ Create a planner on GitHub
+ Discuss with everyone, create tasks, and assign tasks to people
+ Make sure the teams update you regulalry, and the board is updated as people progress

### Team Invitations

+ Create a list of 12 names for invitations to your party (load to GitHub).
+ Create an issue/project task with a tick list for each name and tick them off as you recieve replies (from CM)
+ Create a simple markdown file (or whatever you like) as an invitation template and commit it to GitHub.
+ Respond to any issue that might need changes, making commits/pull requests as you go.


### Team Catering

+ Create a list of various party food, add this as a 'markdown' file (text file with `.md` extension, like this file.)
+ Respond to Issues when the food list has been viewed by others.
+ You are also responsible for a birthday cake, and need to write a recipe:
    + One of your team should write a brief cake recipe and commit it as `cake_recipe.md` markdown file. Quickly commit the file with just a heading, before additional commits.
    + Another member of your team should pick up `cake_recipe.md` and add a section for decorating instructions.
    + Both should be submitted as pull requests, and we will see how we can intergrate these changes into main repo.



### Team Games

+ Decide on a couple of party games, and create an issue / project task in the planner for each of them.  They can be sub-issues of a 'games' issue.
+ Take one game for each member of you team and write a set of instructions, and save as an `.md` file.



# Principles

+ It's a bit of fun.  We'll all get it wrong, but it's worth exploring in a low-stakes setting.
+ When using issues / project tasks, remeber to categorise and assign people to them.
+ Remeber to make changes: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` to get them into your fork.
+ Remeber to 'contribute' or open a 'pull request' to integrate your changes to the main project.

__Ask CM for help if needed.  It's no bother__
