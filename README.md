# Kids Party

This is a training excerise for GitHub.  We are doing something a bit daft, rather than using production code to learn.

___Let's plan a kids birthday party...___

# Activities

We are meeting on the 04/07/2025, and we are planning a kids party for 26/04/2025.
Your venue is the Village Hall, at 11 a.m.

We need to adopt a few roles, and figure out and/plan and decide on a few tasks.

## Roles
+ Party planner (you are going to be the boss of the planning elements)  -  you can also be part of another team
+ Team __Inivitations__
+ Team __Catering__
+ Team __Games__
+ Master of Ceremonies / Dugeon Master / Bringer of Mayhem...  (Other titles for 'organiser are also valid')

Please divide yourself up into teams (one person in a team is ok.)

## Activities

### Planning
+ Create a planner on GitHub
+ Discuss with everyone, create tasks, and assign tasks to people
+ Make sure the teams update you regulalry, and the board is updated as people progress

### Team Invitations

+ Create a list of 12 names for invitations to your party (load to GitHub).
+ Create an issue with a tick list for each name and tick them off as you recieve replies (from CM)
+ Create a simple markdown file (or whatever you like) as an invitation template and commit it to GitHub.
+ Respond to anything that changes, making commits/changes as you go.


### Team Catering

+ Create a list of various party food, add this as a 'markdown' file (text file with `.md` extension, like this file.)
+ Respond to Issues when the food list has been viewed by others.
+ You are also responsible for a birthday cake, and need to write a recipe:
    + One of your team should write a brief cake recipe and commit it as `cake_recipe.md` markdown file. Quickly commit the file with just a heading, before additional commits.
    + Another member of your team should pick up `cake_recipe.md` and add a section for decorating instructions.
    + Both should be submitted as pull requests, and we will see how we can intergrate these changes into main repo.
